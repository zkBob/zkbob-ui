# Contributing to zkBob
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. For any technical questions you can also use [our Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zkbob)

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed/added any features, update [the documentation](https://docs.zkbob.com/) in the specific section.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/zkBob/zkbob-ui/issues)
